# extensible-locks
Lock/RLock classes that are extensible.

Every other class in `threading` is extensible. But neither of the locks are.

If you need extensible locks, use these instead.

Conforms exactly to the `threading.Lock` and `threading.RLock` class signatures in 
[`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/threading.html#module-threading).
